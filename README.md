# Sign Language Translator

SSD is a popular algorithm in object detection. Itâ€™s generally faster than Faster RCNN. In this project we have train SSD model on custom dataset , by doing this model is able to classify various type of 'Alphabets'. This way an effective Sign language Translator can be made . This type of project is not only bound to SSD-mobilenet , various Object detection algorithm can be used.
