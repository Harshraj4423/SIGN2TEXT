# Sign Language Translator

SSD is a popular algorithm in object detection. Itâ€™s generally faster than Faster RCNN. In this project we have train SSD model on custom dataset , by doing this model is able to classify various type of 'Alphabets'. This way an effective Sign language Translator can be made . This type of project is not only bound to SSD-mobilenet , various Object detection algorithm can be used. 


### Print Detailed Info About Each Detection (class, confidence, bounding box coordinates)
I have created a custom flag called <strong>INFO</strong> that can be added to any detect.py or detect_video.py commands in order to print detailed information about each detection made by the object detector. To print the detailed information to your command prompt just add the flag `--info` to any of your commands. The information on each detection includes the class, confidence in the detection and the bounding box coordinates of the detection in xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax format.

### Output of the Model

####         For A in American Sign Language

####         For B in American Sign Language
